<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the rough draft of the README.md file for the johnsonScript programming language.
This is a dynamically-typed language built upon C.

<h2>Types</h2>
There are currently three types in the language. 
- Integers are declared by: var myInt = 10.
- Strings are declared by: var myString = "hello world".
- Booleans are declared by: var myBoolean = True.

Failing to properly set variables equal to a valid type will lead to an error.

<h2>Comments</h2>
Comments are denoted by any line beginning with the '#' character. To do multiline comments, just type a '#' at the start of each line.
Comments are treated as whitespace during lexical analysis.

<h2>Declarations</h2>
There are two things to be declared in the johnsonScript language: variables and functions.
- Variables are declared by var ID = value. or just var ID.
- Functions are declared by def ID(optional arguments). It is then usually followed by a block that begins with start and ends with stop.

<h2>Operators</h2>
The following operators are supported:
- PLUS +
- MINUS -
- TIMES *
- DIVIDES /
- MODULUS %
- NOT not
- AND and
- OR or
- EQUALS ==
- ASSIGN =
- GREATERTHAN >
- LESSTHAN <

<h2>Filetypes</h2>
The correct file extension for the language is the .johns extension.
