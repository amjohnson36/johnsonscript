<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the rough draft of the README.md file for the johnsonScript programming language.
This is a dynamically-typed language built upon C.

<h2>Types</h2>
There are currently three types in the language.<br/>
- Integers are declared by: var myInt = 10.<br/>
- Strings are declared by: var myString = "hello world".<br/>
- Booleans are declared by: var myBoolean = True.<br/>

Failing to properly set variables equal to a valid type will lead to an error.

<h2>Comments</h2>
Comments are denoted by any line beginning with the '#' character. To do multiline comments, just type a '#' at the start of each line.
Comments are treated as whitespace during lexical analysis.

<h2>Declarations</h2>
There are two things to be declared in the johnsonScript language: variables and functions.<br/>
- Variables are declared by var ID = value. or just var ID.<br/>
- Functions are declared by def ID(optional arguments). It is then usually followed by a block that begins with start and ends with stop.<br/>

<h2>Operators</h2>
The following operators are supported:
- PLUS +<br/>
- MINUS -<br/>
- TIMES * <br/>
- DIVIDES / <br/> 
- MODULUS % <br/>
- NOT not <br/>
- AND and <br/>
- OR or <br/>
- EQUALS == <br/>
- ASSIGN = <br/>
- GREATERTHAN > <br/>
- LESSTHAN < <br/>

<h2>Filetypes</h2>
The correct file extension for the language is the .johns extension.
